## Upgrade instructions

Switch your build to use Gradle @version@ by updating your wrapper:

`./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=@version@`

See the [Gradle 8.x upgrade guide](userguide/upgrading_version_8.html#changes_@baseVersion@) to learn about deprecations, breaking changes, and other considerations when upgrading to Gradle @version@.

For Java, Groovy, Kotlin, and Android compatibility, see the [full compatibility notes](userguide/compatibility.html).   

## New features and usability improvements

<!-- Do not add breaking changes or deprecations here! Add them to the upgrade guide instead. -->

### FILL-IN-KEY-AREA improvements

<<<FILL IN CONTEXT FOR KEY AREA>>>
Example:
> The [configuration cache](userguide/configuration_cache.html) improves build performance by caching the result of
> the configuration phase. Using the configuration cache, Gradle can skip the configuration phase entirely when
> nothing that affects the build configuration has changed.

#### FILL-IN-FEATURE
> HIGHLIGHT the usecase or existing problem the feature solves
> EXPLAIN how the new release addresses that problem or use case
> PROVIDE a screenshot or snippet illustrating the new feature, if applicable
> LINK to the full documentation for more details

#### Ability to set conventions on file collections

Plugin-provided tasks often expose file collections that are meant to be customizable by build engineers (for instance, the classpath for the JavaCompile task).
Up until now, for plugin authors to define default values for file collections, they have had to resort to configuring those defaults as initial values.
Conventions provide a better model for that: plugin authors recommend default values via conventions, and users choose to accept, add on top, or completely 
replace them when defining their actual value.

This release introduces a  pair of [`convention(...)`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/file/ConfigurableFileCollection.html#convention-java.lang.Object...-) methods 
on `ConfigurableFileCollection` that define the default value of a file collection if no explicit value is previously set via `setFrom(...)` or `from(...)`.

```kotlin
val files = objects.fileCollection().convention("dir1")
files.from("dir2")

println(files.elements.get()) // [.../dir1, .../dir2]
```

`#from(...)` will honor the convention if one is configured when invoked, so the order of operations will matter. 

To forcefully override or prevent a convention (i.e., regardless of the order of those operations), one should use `#setFrom()` instead:

```kotlin
val files = objects.fileCollection().convention("dir1")
files.setFrom("dir2")


println(files.elements.get()) // [.../dir2]
```

This feature caters to plugin developers.
It is analogous to the [`convention(...)`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/provider/Property.html#convention-T-) methods that have been available on lazy properties since Gradle 5.1.

#### Improved error handling for toolchain resolvers

When attempting to download Java toolchains from the configured resolvers, errors will be better handled now, and all resolvers will be tried.

While mapping toolchain specs to download URLs, resolvers aren't supposed to throw exceptions. 
But it is possible for them to do that, and when it happens, Gradle should try to use other configured resolvers in their stead.
However, it wasn't the case before this fix.

Also, auto-provisioning can fail even after a successful toolchain spec to URL mapping (for example, during the actual download and validating of the toolchain)
In such a case, Gradle should retry the auto-provisioning process with other configured resolvers.
This was also not the case before the fix.

### Other improvements

#### Tests metadata improvements in tooling API

IDEs and other tools leverage the tooling API to access information about tests executed by Gradle.
Each test event sent via the tooling API includes a test descriptor containing metadata such as a human-readable name, class name, and method name.

We introduced a new method to the `TestOperationDescriptor` interface to provide the test display name – `getTestDisplayName`.
It returns the display name of the test that can be used by IDEs to present the test in a human-readable format.
It is transparently passed from the frameworks, enabling IDEs to use them without requiring transformations.
Previously, the display name could be obtained only by parsing the operation display name, which was not always reliable.

Additionally, for JUnit5 and Spock, we updated the test descriptor for dynamic and parameterized tests to include information about the class name and method name containing the test.
These enhancements enable IDEs to offer improved navigation and reporting capabilities for dynamic and parameterized tests.

#### Fix IDE performance issues with large projects

A performance issue in the Tooling API causing delays at the end of task execution in large projects has been identified and fixed by a community member.
This problem occurred while transmitting task information for executed tasks to the IDE. 

After executing approximately 15,000 tasks, the IDE would encounter a delay of several seconds. 
The root cause was that much more information than needed was serialized via the Tooling API.
We added a test to the fix to ensure there will be no future regression, demonstrating a performance improvement of around 12%.
The environments that benefit from this fix are Android Studio, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and other Tooling API clients.
